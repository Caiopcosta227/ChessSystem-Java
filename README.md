# ChessSystem-Java:

Java project for a simple Chess Game to be run in the terminal.

My goal with this project is to practice my skills on tha JAVA language course I bought in Udemy.

If you are reading this, know this is my first project, but I'm putting a lot of effort to it.

Thank you for your attention.
